make a remote repositorry from scratch.
Today I learned how to use git and how to push my local repository to github
and a little time to paratice, I can obviously use git very fluently.
today is june 1 I'm going to experience the pattern of work
this is the change on the dev branch.
I write something down on this 'newdev' branch, and I want to check it on github.let's find out what will happen.
and another line in newdev branch. after this I will merge it to main branch.
is this how things going? I don't know but I can feel this is not good!
